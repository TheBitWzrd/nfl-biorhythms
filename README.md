# nfl-biorhythms

Introduction:
In the pursuit of continuous growth and skill development, this project serves as an opportunity to exercise and enhance my proficiency in data analysis. By combining my existing knowledge of Python, SQL, and statistical analysis, I aim to bridge the gaps between these disciplines and further strengthen my expertise in this field.

Inspiration:
Inspired by my grandfather, a collector and purveyor of eclectic knowledge, I find myself delving into the fascinating realm of biorhythms. His knack for sparking curiosity and encouraging critical thinking has fueled my passion for exploring unconventional topics. Biorhythms, despite being regarded by many as a pseudo-science, present an intriguing concept that proposes cyclical patterns in our physical, emotional, and intellectual cycles.

Connecting Biorhythms to Major Sports Events:
It is during the anticipation and excitement surrounding major sports events that the subject of biorhythms often resurfaces in my family. The idea that the critical intersection of these cycles might influence outcomes resonates, particularly within the realm of sports. With this project, I aim to explore the potential connection between biorhythm calculations and the performance of NFL quarterbacks, specifically in high-stakes games.

Approach and Methodology:
To accomplish this, I will leverage my Python programming skills to collect and analyze relevant data. SQL will be used to efficiently manage the database and retrieve necessary information. Employing statistical analysis techniques, I will examine the past five years of NFL data, including game outcomes and player performace, to determine what effect if any biorhythms may have had on the outcome. Through rigorous analysis and data visualization, I hope to uncover any patterns or correlations (or lack thereof) that may exist between biorhythms and the success of quarterbacks in these crucial games.

By undertaking this project, I not only aim to strengthen my data analysis skills but also contribute to the ongoing discourse surrounding the intersection of sports, human performance, and intriguing concepts like biorhythms.
